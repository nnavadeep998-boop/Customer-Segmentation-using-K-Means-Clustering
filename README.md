# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project segments customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is used to group customers with similar characteristics such as annual income and spending score. This helps businesses understand customer patterns and target them effectively.
Algorithm Used
